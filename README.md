# Test

When running `yarn build` webpack will work.
When running `yarn start` I get this output but nothing else happens, webpack is not building anything:

```
$ yarn start
yarn run v1.5.1
$ webpack-serve webpack.config.js
ℹ ｢serve｣: Project is running at http://localhost:8080
ℹ ｢serve｣: Server URI copied to clipboard
```
